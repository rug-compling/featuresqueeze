Feature selection for maximum entropy modeling
==============================================
DaniÃ«l de Kok <me@danieldk.eu>

Compilation
-----------

Requirements:

- C++ standard library with TR1 extensions.
- C++ compiler with support for C++0x (for type inference).

g++ 4.4.x satisfies these requirements. With these components in place,
compile by simply executing 'make' in the top-level directory.

To do
-----

- Make robust for erroneous input (display an error rather than segfaulting).
- Test with more datasets, the program currently fails on some datasets that
  are very much different from mine.
- Implement fast feature selection as in [2].
- Command line argument handling (e.g. for setting thresholds).
- Verbose output.
