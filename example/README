This directory contains sample data based on 100 sentences from the
Dutch Wikipedia, extracted in the following manner:

- Parse the sentences using the Alpino parser. Create an abstract
  dependency tree of the best parse.
- Generate from the abstract dependency trees using the Alpino
  generator, extracting features.
- Score each realization for an abstract dependency tree by comparing
  it to the reference sentence.

Simple execute:

make fluency.best_features

This will do feature selection, and rewrite feature numbers into
feature names.
